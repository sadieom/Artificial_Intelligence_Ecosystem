Run the Basic Classifier
Use the provided base_classifier.py to classify your chosen image.

Prompt the AI to explain each line of the code:

“Explain what each line of this Python program does.”

Reflect Base Classifier Explanation:

I used chatGPT to explain each line to me in the base_classifier.py file and I 
feel the explaination was fairly easy to understand. The program we are using currently 
uses a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model from TensorFlow to classify images. It imports teh libraries 
it needs like TensorFlow, Keras tools for image preprocessing, and NumPy for array handling. With the 
model already loaded with ImageNet "weights" so it already knows how to recognize a wide variety of 
objects.

Grad_CAM Observations:

With my Grad_CAM I am not exactly sure why but it didn't seem to "focus" on one area. My observation of the image
with the Grad_CAM is that it knows it is a dog for the most part (the predictions prove that it is about 65% sure it
is a dog). It focuses on the legs mostly for some reason, and then loses focus or interst in the head area of the dog. 

Basic Filter Explanation:

Everything the Ai said for each line makes sense, this program asks the user for an image file, resizes it to 128×128, applies a 
Gaussian blur, and saves a new blurred version with _blurred added to its filename, while gracefully handling errors.
